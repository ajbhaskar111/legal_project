                                            Mortgage deeds are legal documents or instruments that pass over a property’s legal rights to the loan provider, which they can exercise in case of a loan default. This document gives lenders the property rights to sell the foreclosed property and recoup their defaulted loan amount to protect their interest.

                                    The person who mortgages a property against a loan is termed a mortgagor, whereas the person or party who lends a loan against the property is called a mortgagee. The mortgage deed contains all the loan terms and conditions involved. Registration of the deed is essential to give it legal validity. For registration, both parties must sign the deed, pay stamp duty, and at least two witnesses must attest to it.
                                    </p>

                                    After understanding the mortgage deed meaning, you should know that it is necessary when a property owner loans money from a lending institution and transfers their property’s interest to the lender. In other words, when you borrow a loan against your property, the deed secures both parties’ interest and rights over the asset. Here are a few reasons why a deed is important:
