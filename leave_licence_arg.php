                                    An agreement to sell is a contract between a seller and a buyer in which the seller agrees to sell property to the buyer at a specified price. It is generally used to sell immovable property such as land or buildings. The Agreement to Sell includes all the terms and conditions agreed upon by both parties.

                                    A Leave and Licence Agreement by which rights to use and occupy a property are temporarily transferred. The property owner i.e. 'Licensor,' grants permission to another party i.e. 'Licencee,' to occupy the premises for a specified period.

                                    Also, there is a clear difference between a lease and a leave and Licence agreement. Unlike traditional leases, the latter does not transfer ownership or create a landlord-tenant relationship. Instead, it confers a limited right to use the property. This distinction is crucial, as it allows for easy eviction in case of disputes.
